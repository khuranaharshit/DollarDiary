# DollarDiary

## End Goal:
- App for tracking daily transactions and managing your money better.

### Integrations
- Get input from various apps like Khatabook, Splitwise and other money managing apps.
- Ability to export data in different formats like csv etc that could then be consumed by other 
apps like google-sheets, Splitwise etc

### Initial Stages
- It is just for pulling data from Splitwise and then being able to tag an 
expense, and further being able to group and summarise expenses by different groups. There is no
limit on number of tags for an expense, but user should be mindful while tagging an expense.
    - It will then support exporting it in different formats.
